# astro-component-tester

Utility to help you write tests for your Astro components. In essence, what it does is create a temporary empty Astro project with only the selected component and then it returns the final output of an Astro build. In the future, I hope you add more useful tools for testing your component

While it's intended to be used when writing tests, you could also use it outside of that usecase, if needed ðŸ˜„

## Usage

Examples below uses Mocha and Chai for convenience but this should work with any tools

```js
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { buildComponent } from 'astro-component-tester';

describe('Component', async () => {
  // Component content here is equal to simply <div>Hello</div>
  before(async () => {
    component = await buildComponent('./src/Component.astro');
  });

  it('example component should say hello', async () => {
    expect(component.html).to.contain('Hello');
  });
});
```

You can also pass props to the component, using the following method:

### Component

```astro
---
  const {
    mySuperProp
  } = Astro.props
---

<div>{ mySuperProp + 1 }</div>
```

### Test

```js
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { buildComponent } from 'astro-component-tester';

describe('Component', async () => {
  before(async () => {
    component = await buildComponent('./src/Component.astro', { mySuperProp: 1 });
  });

  it('example component should say hello', async () => {
    expect(component.html).to.contain(2);
  });
});
```

## Limitations

### Cannot currently pass options to Astro

It is not currently supported to pass options to Astro, so tests based on Astro-related settings don't work

### React/Vue/Svelte etc components

See previous point, since it's currently not possible to pass settings to Astro, renderers are currently not supported

### Context-specific variables

Since this work by building the component in an isolated environment, any variables depending on a specific context will be lost. For instance, `Astro.request` will always simply return the index page. Presumably, if you're building a component that should work in any instance, this wouldn't be an issue but it could become one for some components. At the moment, `astro-component-tester` does not support any kind of mocking for supporting that use case
